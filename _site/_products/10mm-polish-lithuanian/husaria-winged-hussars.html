<p>The husaria were famous not only for their wings but for the unique tactic of <q>late concentration</q> that kept their losses low. Riders would advance slowly, in a loose formation, until the first volley of enemy musket fire before then closing ranks and accelerating towards the enemy line.</p>

<p>This is a Husaria (Winged Hussars) unit of twelve strips of one figure each (12 figures total). You will recieve one commander strip (pl01a), one standard bearer (pl01b), ten rank and file strips (a mix of pl01c–g) and twelve wings (a mix of pl01h–j). Bases are not included but are <a href="/store/bases/">available separately</a>.</p>
