After a minor delay due to a blown compressor, I picked up the production models this morning. I managed to spot check a few of them and grab some pictures before work. The quality is excellent from what I've seen. I'm hoping to have everyone's pledges shipped out in the next two weeks. You guys should be seeing invoices for the shipping and extras soon.
