I snapped some shots of the 10mm Landsknecht Arquebusiers production metals last night.

I packed around a fourth of the units last night and should get to some more tonight. Kickstarter backers can expect their shipping invoices either Friday or Monday. I hope to have these up on the website by the end of the month.
