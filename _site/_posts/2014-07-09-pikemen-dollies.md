I just received a picture of the Pikemen dollies this morning from Bob Naismith. He said they should be done in the next week to ten days:

I've also commissioned another rank and file Zweih√§nder strip. Both units will now have two of each of the seven rank and file strips and a banner/musician strip (15 strips/30 figures total).
